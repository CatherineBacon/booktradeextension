# booktradingclub

This app was created as part of the following FreeCodeCamp challenge:
https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club

**Final app: https://catherinebookexchange.herokuapp.com/**

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](http://bookjump.herokuapp.com/).

### User Stories:

- I can view all books posted by every user.
- I can add a new book.
- I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
- I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

## Libraries/Frameworks

I used [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) as the platform. Combined with [React](https://guide.meteor.com/react.html). I also used [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router) for the routing.

List of book options and book cover image obtained from the [node google-books-search api](https://github.com/smilledge/node-google-books-search).

It is styled with [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and the Flatly theme on [boostswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

I also used [react-selectize](https://github.com/furqanZafar/react-selectize) for the dropdown.
